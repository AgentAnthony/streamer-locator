# python-wireshark-geolocate

A script to geolocate people on streaming media using **Wireshark/tshark** and the **[maxminddb-geolite2](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/maxminddb-geolite2/2015.0303)** python module. Tested on Omegle and Chatroulette. 

I created this script as an experiment after learning about wireshark in my computer communications class. It's for educational/harmless purposes only. Please don't try to use it to stalk or scare people.
